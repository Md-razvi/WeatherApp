## OVERVIEW
The Weather App is a simple and interactive web application built with React that provides real-time weather updates using the OpenWeather API. Users can enter a city name to get detailed weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed. The app features a clean and user-friendly interface, ensuring seamless interaction.

## TOOLS

- **Code Editor**: Visual Studio Code
- **Frontend Tools**: Vite with React and JavaScript
- **API**: [OpenWeather API](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q={city_name}&appid={API_KEY}&units=metric)
- **API Testing Tools**: Thunder Client (VS Code), Postman (optional)
- **Styling**: CSS, Tailwind CSS (optional for responsiveness)
- **State Management**: React Hooks (useState, useEffect)

The additional `units=metric` parameter in the API URL ensures temperature conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius. To use this API, log in to the OpenWeather app to generate your **API key**. The **city name** is provided by the user as input.

## DESCRIPTION

The application is a simple **Weather App Web Page** that displays real-time weather information for a selected city. The user selects a location using a dropdown menu, and the app fetches and displays relevant weather data. 

The key features include:

- **Weather Cards**: Display temperature, humidity, and wind speed in a structured format.
- **Dropdown Selection**: Allows users to select a city from a predefined list.
- **API Integration**: Retrieves weather data dynamically based on user input.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can type and search for any city worldwide.
- **Error Handling**: Displays appropriate messages if the city is not found or API fails.
- **Loading Indicator**: Shows a loading spinner while fetching data from the API.

Using the Thunder Client, we integrate the following basic features:

1. **Temperature**
2. **Humidity**
3. **Wind Speed**
4. **Weather Description** (e.g., Cloudy, Rainy, Sunny)
5. **Icon Representation** (Displays weather icons based on conditions)

To obtain latitude and longitude for specific locations, you can use the website [LatLong.net](https://www.latlong.net/).
